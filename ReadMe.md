# Unit 16 Assignment 2

This is my submission for Unit 16 Assignment 2.

The assignment asks to write the code for 2 problems, and I have decided to put them in separate folders.

In each folder, you will find three subfolders:

- `code`: Contains the source code of the program.
- `doc`: Contains any documentation relating to the problem.
- `build`: Contains a built version of the code that can easily be launched.

## How to launch programs

Clone this repo

### Problem 1

For problem 1, I decided to use Blazor to create the todo app. Because I used Blazor to create the app I struggled to find a free method of hosting it.

To launch the program:

Navigate to `Problem-1/build`

Launch `Blazor server app.exe`

A console will appear with the address of the webpage

### Problem 2

For problem 2, I decided to create a simple console app with a menu.
The original data given for problem 2 was a .xlsx file (Microsoft Excel worksheet), but the assignment asked for a .csv file. Therefore, I converted the .xlsx file to a .csv file.

To launch the program:

Navigate to `Problem-2/build`

Launch `Problem 2.exe`

A console will appear
